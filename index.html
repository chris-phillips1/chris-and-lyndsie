            <p class="card-content">
              I created this website as a way to express my love to the special
              one in my life, Lyndsie. You are the light of my world, my love. I
              would not be the person I am today without you. After 2 years of
              excitement, love, and adventure, I know that you will continue to
              make life a wonderful experience. This website will always be in
              flux, with new content and ideas for different celebrations
              throughout the year.
            </p>
            <p class="card-content">
              Currently, the theme of this website will revolve around the
              concept of music. Since we are both so interested in music, and
              generally have similar tastes, I thought it might be good to focus
              on music that connects us and helps to tell our story. Throughout
              preparation of this website, I have curated a spotify playlist
              along with a collection of my thoughts listed below.

            <p class="card-content">
              Our relationship began with a shared appreciation for music,
              specifically, Taylor Swift. While there may be no Taylor Swift on
              this particular playlist, I think that a lot of the musical styles
              present here are similar. A lot of this playlist might be
              classified as "soft pop", but I have also included some other
              tracks that might deviate from that style of music. These songs
              are different because they have some lyrical or musical
              signficance to our story that is explained below. Each and every
              one of these songs has some sigificance and meaning to me and I
              hope that you will also see this meaning with time.

            To me, this song is the perfect song to open this playlist with. It
            really does a good job of expressing how I've felt in this
            relationship for a while. Specifically, I relate to the idea that
            I've been "looking for something" and I found it when I met you. The
            use of a broad term like "something" expresses a sort of ignorance
            and not necessarily knowing what is being looked for. However, whats
            important is that I know I have finally found it. And that is our
            relationship. I have found the love of my life.

            This song represents something that we have both struggled with and
            are both getting better with. I'm referring to the mental health
            struggles we both face. I think this song illustrates some of what
            we have. We will support each other in dark times "gray skies" and
            help make them better. Ultimately, we have both planted love within
            each other, and it shows in how we operate now.

            This song seems to focus more on travel/distance and it reminded me

            from this is that no matter where we are, even if it's just a
            facetime call, when we're together I feel at home. We have shown so
            much strength by persisting through so many months of long distance.
            Once we are finally together long-term, we could "hit the highway"
            and see all the sights we want.

            This song certainly touches on insecurities that I've felt. You have
            helped me to move past them and understand my own worth. I sometimes
            questioned whether I was good enough for a relationship, especially
            with you. Your continuous reassurance, love, and support have helped
            to feel confident in our love and thrive in our relationship. I also

            I figured I had to have one classic, catchy, pop song in this
            playlist. So here it is! Honestly though, you've given me a reason
            to keep moving, to wake up every morning and try to love you the way
            you love me. You've shown me what true love, kindness, and trust are
            and how they can be done. I will spend every morning away from you
            looking for that way to see your face and feel your love.

            We're always gonna be there for each other. That's what this song
            reinforces for me. While we may have our conflicts or our struggles
            together, we will still help each other through the darkness. We
            both provide light when all the other person can see is darkness. We
            contrast in ways that ensure we are never alone in the darkness of
            life.

            Listening to this song, I imagined it from your perspective. I
            imagine some time in the future where we are having our weekend
            adventures and you're writing songs about these adventures. I also
            have some humor in recognizing the lyric, "Stole your heart and I
            got lucky". We both know I was completely oblivious in the beginning
            and it really was luck that we did find out we both liked each
            other. Now we have each others' hearts for a million days and more.
